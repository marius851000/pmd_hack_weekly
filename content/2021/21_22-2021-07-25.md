::: title 2 HackNews-Pika "Crashing Dimension and 99 updates !"

*By PikaNiko in the SkyTemple Discord server*

> <u>Pika news #1</u>
> 
> **PMD: Crashing Dimension**
> 
> As now PMD: Crashing Dimension covers several PokÃ©mon games in plot. I have done a lot of researching about this and have brainstormed a lot of ideas.
> 
> So while there will be a written story of PMD: Crashing Dimension, I decide to use animation (just like PMD Retold) and some of the boss battle and important dungeon of PMD: Crashing Dimension will be in game form. :sneaseldizzy: 
> 
> **PMD: 99**
> 
> Next version of PMD: 99 will finish the modifying of all dungeons and finish the rebalance of the game. (and of course the problem that the patch cannot be used) :vulpix:

::: title 2 HackNews-Hell "Explorers of Hell trailer and r-word removal"

*later...*

> Hi everyone! Here is the trailer on YouTube, I invite you to see it, it has a few more videos and shows a new feature that is not on the twitter trailer! Enjoy! :sparkles:

::: youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNdX1ZbNSPM

*also*

> Hi everyone, I removed the r-word from the scripts to avoid offending some people. The game will still have an open humor, because that's the whole point of the game. It's possible that I forgot to remove 1 or 2 r-words, if you come across them when you play the game, please let me know and the correction will be made!

> Thanks again for all your positive messages, they make me very happy, I really hope you will enjoy the game and have a good time on it! :pokepika:

::: title 2 HackNews-Distant "Distant Connection news !"

*Both by runway55 on the distant connection Discord*

> Distant Connection will now be an episodic release, with a few chapters for each release. With this, the new planned release for the first episode of Distant Connection will now be Fall 2021.

> Been a while since I've gave an update on the status of DC's development, but I got something. The script is roughly 25-35%, which means the first episode's script is complete, so I'll start working on that in SkyTemple either when the script is 100% complete or when SkyTemple 1.3 is released, whichever comes first. Development has been slow so I'm going to work on focusing on it more and will work to have the script done by the end of the month.

*followed by a seemingly unrelated joke*

::: title 2 HackNews-Spirit "Explorers of the Spirit looking for testers"

::: title 3 SkyTemple-NewFeatures "New Features"
- [Commited by End45](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-files/pull/142): Add EditExtraPokemon patch (more information are avalaible in the merge request)
  > Adds a patch that un-hardcodes the way the game adds additional pokÃ©mon to the team when entering uncleared dungeons. This data will now be part of a table inside arm9.bin, making it possible to edit it with a hex editor.
    - Commited by End45 ([backend](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-files/pull/145), [frontend](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple/pull/310)): Ability to edit guest pokÃ©mon data (requires the EditExtraPokemon patch to be applied).
      > Adds a new screen under "Lists" that can be used to change which dungeons add guest pokÃ©mon to your team when they are uncleared and what pokÃ©mon they add. The new screen also allows changing some dungeon data that was previously hardcoded by ID, such as which dungeons have Hidden Land-like restrictions active.

A potential improvement to the screen would be changing the guest columns to use a dropdown listing all the guest data entries instead of an integer.

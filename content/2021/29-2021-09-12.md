*By Babou in Babou's Discord server*

> Hi everyone! PMD Hell V1.3.1 and PMD Heaven 1.1.1 are available in rom-download! This is just a few bug fixes. If you don't have the Magic Cave in the dungeon selection, and you have already beaten Raikou, go talk to Lucario on the beach, after you beat Darkrai. It will give you access to the Magic Cave. The 1.4 and 1.2 will arrive in October, I'm still working on it, I hope you'll keep having fun on Hell and Heaven! :shyrouge:

::: title 1 EditorNotes "Editor's Notes"

Hello. Made quite some time I wrote anything here. So, two (a bit more personal) things that I didn't feel enter the other categories :

1. Irdkwia, for some (unspecified) reason, left the Discord server (while deleting a bunch of GitHub repository. But that won't be too much of problem in itself, there are other copies). Irdkwia made an important part of the existing assembly patches in SkyTemple (as you can see in the ``1.3.0`` changelog). I would like to thank him for what he did, hoping Irdkwia isn't having any problem.

2. Following this, I figured it could be an appropriate time to share a project I've had. It concern long term (a.k.a as long as there is someone to host it) archiving of PMD rom-hacking related content. I've started by sharing a copy of all the published rom-hack I've collected (as of 06/09/2021). You can download it here : [https://marius851000-drive.mycozy.cloud/public?sharecode=JX4ddpznAGkL](https://marius851000-drive.mycozy.cloud/public?sharecode=JX4ddpznAGkL). This way, if a patch is being made unavailaible for any reason, it can be retrieved from this archive (or any other copy if it can't be downloaded from there). A limition of my archive is that it only copy the rom-hack patches, and so, don't include videos uploaded on youtube (nor code or document. In particular, those on google docs could be important to save).
In particular, I would ask if any reader know a good software/tool/method for archiving those kind of stuff. The current approch is using a folder per rom hack, with some metadata. Ideally, I would like to be able to expose that directly on the internet for easier searching/discovery (potentially in addition of allowing more people than just me to upload content). It should also be easy to share as a simple folder/group of folder, and shouldn't require specialized software to access the archived content from a local copy (other than a patching tools for applying patch/reading video file/opening documents, of course).
In case you know of any software/tools/source on how to do this, I'll be happy to hear about it (or any other input on this subject). Otherwise, I'll just probably write a software that does this.

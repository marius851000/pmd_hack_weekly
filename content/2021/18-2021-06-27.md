::: title 2 HackNews-EOH "Explorers of Hell news"

*From [Babou's Discord server](https://discord.gg/6QbPHYZDtg)*

> Hello @everyone! Here is some news about Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Hell. Expect little or no news until the game is released.
> 
> - Some bosses will be replayable in "Hell" mode. Here is an example with the replay against Dusknoir
> - You will get an HM by going up in exploration rank
> - The guild's Q&A table now answers more useful questions
> - All Legendary Pokemon will be recruitable in Shiny. You will need Mystery Part/Secret Slab, and they will appear in a dungeon floor with a very low percentage
> - A new dungeon: Victory Road, which can be unlocked after graduation, and will allow you to recruit Victini 
> 
> Thanks again to all those who follow the progress of the game, a release date will be communicated in August, I hope you will like the game! :totolaugh:

FireFox6 shared a video with the two first cutscenes of Explorers of Death

> I've come a long way in both romhacking and video editing skills since the last time Youtube saw my hack (The Skytemple hack showcase video). The hack is still in development, there's alot more done than what you see here.
> Keep in mind that what is shown here may be changed later
> 
> If you wish to see updates about the romhack, join the Explorers of Death Discord Server! DM my Discord Account, FireFox6#/3633 (ignore the slash) for a link. (Be sure to specifically ask for a link, if you just say "hello" or something similar, I may ignore you).

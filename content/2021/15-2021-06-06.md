I also made some changes to the site. Right now, I host this website using the free Azure credit offered by my school. I plan on getting my hands on a custom domain name (either paid or via eu.org), as well as possibly self hosting it via my Rasberry Pi for educational purposes.

# Rescue Team Hacking
## Video explaining the IA of RRT
AnonymousRandPerson published a video on Reddit explaining how the IA in Rescue Team works.

## Progress on PMD Red Rescue Team Decompilation
While I haven't made a list of exact changes yet, there seems to be a lot of progress in the PMD Red Rescue Team decompilation effort. [Take a look if you're interested](https://github.com/pret/pmd-red)! For those unfamiliar with the concept, decompilation is the process of recreating the code of a game or other program based on released, 'compiled' data.

# Explorers Hacking
## Pokémon Mystery Dungeon 99 - Team Change
Alekemon first announced that Pokémon Mystery Dungeon 99 was cancelled, and then said it would be continued by Team Pika. Alekemon says he will be making PMD Hidden Explorers instead.

*Alekemon, 4 months ago, about PMD 99:*
> Explorers of Sky... but different!
> 
> - Every dungeon has 99 floors
>
> - Your Pokémon has to be Lvl 1 to enter
>
> - Sylveon added with moveset and stats but Normal-type (Credits: Fable: [https://twitter.com/fabledpainter](https://twitter.com/fabledpainter))

## Explorers of Hell Progress Update
> Hi everyone! Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Hell is more than halfway through development! The game is still scheduled for September. Here are some news about the progress, V0.3 will be released next week for beta-testers, and very few news will be communicated from July.
> 
> - New title screen.
>
> - All pokemon have now 2 abilities, even the legendary ones. It is either their secret ability or a new one. The goal is to have the best balance possible, so Blaziken will not have Speed Boost for example. In addition, each final form of Pokemon will learn several of its eggmoves by leveling up.
> 
> - New special Pokemon will be recruitable thanks to the mystery part/secret slab, like Primal Dialga or Shiny Celebi.
> 
> - A new special dungeon accessible after graduation, this one will allow you to meet and recruit pokemon gen 5 and more.
> 
> - A Kangaskhan Rock in the Marowak Dojo with several options.
> 
> - With the absence of special episodes in this game, Star Cave will be accessible after graduation.
> 
> There are still a lot of other features, don't hesitate to keep up to date with the latest news on the [Babou's Guild server!](https://discord.gg/6QbPHYZDtg) :SpindaShake:

## PMD: Distant Connection in Development
*By runway55*
> From a small Hack Jam project, PMD: Distant Connection is now officially in development along with a Discord server and a teaser trailer for what's to come from it! This hack will expand on the characters and the world that was featured in the Hack Jam, as well as actually having dungeons to go with it. This will be a long project and I look forward to the end result of what I create.

## Ass Cucumber's ROM Hack Disqualified Due to its Content
*From the SkyTemple server*
> Hi! We as mod team have decided to disqualify John Cena and the Quest for the Undertale Orgy from the SkyTemple Hack Jam for breaking rule 6. We are sorry we have acted so slow on this and that this is happening after the jam is already over for one week. We will make sure to be more clear about rules in the future and to have a screening in place to prevent this from happening again.
> 
> We still appreciate the work Ass Cucumber put into this a lot! The hack will also remain in the submissions channel until after the jam. You can of course also still talk about it, as long as it doesn't break rule 6.

## Aero's New Hack
> Hi, this is Aero, i'd like to announce that i am starting on a new rom hack, it isnt difficulty this time.
> 
> Go through the hilarious journey and immerse yourself into things that are literally just memes.
>
> (its still gonna be hard as fuck tho)

## DonkinDo's New Discord Server
> Since i have projects i like to have a place to update it, outside twitter. And also a place to talk with other developers, artists, musicians, etc. This place will feature stuff from Bug Fables Demake and PMD: Explorers of Sunlight.

## Tempory New Icon for the SkyTemple Server
To celebrate [LGBT Pride Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_pride#LGBT_Pride_Month), Parakoopa temporarily changed the SkyTemple server's icon. The new icon was made by NeroIntruder based on the original SkyTemple server icon.

## Online Patcher for Sky ROMs
tech-ticks made an [online patcher](https://github.com/SkyTemple/patcher) for ROM hacks. It is targeted at hack-developers who want to use an online interface for users to patch their ROM files.

## SkyTemple
- [Fixed by Parakoopa](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-dtef/commit/643641562f911128c3135da7e970f0fac20d2a79): Fixes importing with animations.

- [Updated by Parakoopa](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple/commit/1e80f897454b4118f21ca57ba7966cb4f0650de8): Lists empty scenes in the UI.

## SkyTemple Merch
*From Parakoopa*
> Alright, so just for fun we have a little merch shop open for a few days haha - currently only the Duskako design is available, the SkyTemple logo is still being approved. Have any other ideas for it? Let me know!

## New Commission Listing Page
I finally added a page to the site listing available commissions. You can access it [here]({filename}/pages/commission_list.md). It also features an updated commission sheet for Emuffin.

## Tilesets
*TilesetCollab when?*

Staro shared two new tilesets in the [#custom-resources channel of their Discord server](https://discord.gg/uTJPcg9sdZ) that can be imported with SkyTemple. There are other tilesets featured in that channel too!

Staro requires credit if you use these tilesets, or any of their resources.

I also made [a page]({filename}/pages/tilesets.md) listing tilesets I've found with permission (although currently all tilesets listed there are by Staro).

## Sprites and Portraits
*Editor's Note: I've finally added support for animated sprites. (It was easier than expected!) Enjoy, though hopefully it doesn't make this newsletter too long.*

*Sprites are animated PNG files. If sprites don't appear animated to you, check to make sure your browser supports animated PNG. (Though most modern browsers should.)*

*This first image is not part of SpriteCollab, but I wanted to feature it anyway since the art is just stellar!*

**Remukko portraits by Remukko**

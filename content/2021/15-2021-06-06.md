Did I miss anything? Feel free to [open a github issue](https://github.com/marius851000/pmd_hack_weekly/issues), contact me on Discord at ``marius851000#2522``, send me an email at ``mariusdavid@laposte.net``, or send me a message from an ActivityPub-compatible service (Mastodon) at ``marius851000@framapiaf.org``.

I also did some change in the site. Right now, I host this website using the free azure credit offered by my school. I plan a getting my hand on a custom domain name (either paid or via eu.org), as well as possibly self hosting it via my rasberry pi for educational purpose.

# Explorers Hacking
## Pokémon Mystery Dungeon 99 - team change
Alekemon first announced the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon 99 was cancelled, and then told it would be continued by Team Pika. Alekemon say he will be making PMD Hiddens Explorers instead.

*Alekemon 4 month ago about PMD 99*
> Explorers of Sky... but different!
> 
> - Every dungeon has 99 floors
>
> - Your Pokémon has to be Lvl 1 to enter
>
> - Sylveon added with moveset and stats but Normal-type (Credits: Fable: [https://twitter.com/fabledpainter](https://twitter.com/fabledpainter))

## Explorers of Hell progress update
> Hi everyone! Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Hell is more than halfway through development! The game is still scheduled for September. Here are some news about the progress, V0.3 will be released next week for beta-testers, and very few news will be communicated from July.
> 
> - New title screen.
>
> - All pokemon have now 2 abilities, even the legendary ones. It is either their secret ability or a new one. The goal is to have the best balance possible, so Blaziken will not have Speed Boost for example. In addition, each final form of Pokemon will learn several of its eggmoves by leveling up.
> 
> - New special Pokemon will be recruitable thanks to the mystery part/secret slab, like Primal Dialga or Shiny Celebi.
> 
> - A new special dungeon accessible after graduation, this one will allow you to meet and recruit pokemon gen 5 and more.
> 
> - A Kangaskhan Rock in the Marowak Dojo with several options.
> 
> - With the absence of special episodes in this game, Star Cave will be accessible after graduation.
> 
> There are still a lot of other features, don't hesitate to keep up to date with the latest news on the [Babou's Guild server!](https://discord.gg/6QbPHYZDtg) :SpindaShake:

## PMD: Distant Connection in development
*by runway55*
> From a small Hack Jam project, PMD: Distant Connection is now officially in development along with a Discord server and a teaser trailer for what's to come from it! This hack will expand on the characters and the world that was featured in the Hack Jam, as well as actually having dungeons to go with it. This will be a long project and I look forward to the end result of what I create.

## ``John Cena and the Quest for the Undertale Orgy`` disqualified due to its content
*From the SkyTemple server*
> Hi! We as mod team have decided to disqualify John Cena and the Quest for the Undertale Orgy from the SkyTemple Hack Jam for breaking rule 6. We are sorry we have acted so slow on this and that this is happening after the jam is already over for one week. We will make sure to be more clear about rules in the future and to have a screening in place to prevent this from happening again.
> 
> We still appreciate the work Ass Cucumber put into this a lot! The hack will also remain in the submissions channel until after the jam. You can of course also still talk about it, as long as it doesn't break rule 6.
> 
> In addition, if you want more update on Ass Cucumbers Hacks, you can visit his Discord server but NOTE that it may contain NSFW or insulting content and we are not responsible in any way for anything posted on it: https://discord.gg/Vbe4A5tvFv

## Tempory new icon for the skytemple server
At the occasion of the [LGDB pride month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_pride#LGBT_Pride_Month), Parakoopa temporally changed the skytemple server icon. Montage made by NeroIntruder based on the original skytemple server icon.

## progress on pmd red decompilation
While I haven't made a list of exact change, there seem to have a lot progress in the pmd red decompilation. [Take a look if you are interested](https://github.com/pret/pmd-red). Decompilation is the concept of recreating the code of a software/game based on released data, with the help of various tools.

## Online patcher for sky rom
Tech-ticks made an [online patcher](https://github.com/SkyTemple/patcher) for romhack. It is targeted at hack-maker, who want to provide an online interface for user to patch roms.

## SkyTemple
- skytemple-dtef had a [fix](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-dtef/commit/643641562f911128c3135da7e970f0fac20d2a79) for import of animation, as well as setting it's version to 1.1.3
- tech-ticks with the help of parakoopa [added support](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple/pull/279) for editing metadata of the nds rom directly via SkyTemple, most notably, the rom name, the id, the localized title, and to import and export the game icon.
- The ability to [add new leve](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple/commit/a75a5edebae446e74323f833c61e1285aefd5777) was added by Parakoopa.
- Empty scenes [are now](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple/commit/1e80f897454b4118f21ca57ba7966cb4f0650de8) listed in the UI.
- You can [now](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple/commit/f2426f0c94caa5bd75d437eca368f97d4736ec3a) add new map background.
- Support to edit the level list [was added](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple/commit/502fc1f9747b24ae038ea5679600d145baee2c3a) by Parakoopa.
- "Ground dungeon tileset mapping" was also [added](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple/commit/8c60c49701bcc6b9353d9eb907b645d38acce895) again, by Parakoopa.


## SkyTemple Merch
*from Parakoopa*
> Alright, so just for fun we have a little merch shop open for a few days haha - currently only the Duskako design is available, the SkyTemple logo is still being approved. Have any other ideas for it? Let me know!

## new page listing commissions
I finally added added a page listing commission on this site. You can access it [here]({filename}/pages/commission_list.md). It include an updated commission sheet for Emuffin.

## Tilesets
*SpriteCollab but for tileset when ?*

Staro shared two new tileset that can be imported in-game with SkyTemple. Found in the #custom-ressources of the staro server. There are other older tileset here too.

You need to credit Staro if you use those tilesets

I also made [a page]({filename}/pages/tilesets.md) listing tilesets I found (thougth I am not aware of tileset that are not made by staro).

## Sprites and Portraits
*Editor's note: I've finally added support for animated sprite (was easier than expected). Hope you enjoy it and don't made this newsletter too long.*

*Sprites are animated using APNG. If sprites aren't animated, check that your browser support it. Only old browser shouldn't support it.*

*this first image is not part of SpriteCollab, but I still decided to integrate it anyway*

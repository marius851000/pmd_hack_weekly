# Explorers Hacking
## Explorers of Skies patch release
*By staro*

> So it seem's yesterday I boofed up and pushed out a release thinking an experimental new feature was going to work perfectly and it didn't. This led to crashes and frame drops for both emulator players and real hardware players. I apologize for any inconvenience, I should have done a third beta test before releasing. This new update remedies that and includes a few new bug fixes. Saves **Should** be alright to transfer over. You should update to this ASAP.
> 
> 1.15.1:
>
> - Removed the ExpandPokeList and ChangeEvoSystem patches.
> 
> - Added Play Rough to Espurr and both Meowstics
>
> - Fixed an issue with a Magmortor becoming the Aggron boss in Special Episode 4 
>
> - Fixed Move Stat Displays not working with two-turn moves.

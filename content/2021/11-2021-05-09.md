### explorers of hell
*by babou on his server*

Hi everyone here is some news about **<u>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon : Explorers of Hell</u>**. The game is progressing very well, the release could be around <u>September</u>.

- The **Fairy type** and the new weaknesses to the steel type from the 6th generation have been added.


- **New Pokemon** : Arceus, Vulpix Alola (starter), Ninetales Alola and Sylveon.

- Some pokemon will be able to appear **shiny** and will be recruitable. They will be available on a single floor of some dungeons. There are **10** : Umbreon, Metagross, Gardevoir, Charizard, Sableye, Flygon, Luxray, Milotic, Magikarp, Gyarados.

- The effect of some attacks has been **changed**. For example, Air Slash hits the whole room, Knock Off deals damage, Howl affects all allies, and many other changes and adjustments.

- The purchase and sale prices of some items have been changed. For example, the Reviver Seed will cost 1200 instead of 800. 

- In some dungeons, if a Pokemon knocks out one of your allies, it will **evolve**.

- You will be able to **freely** change your starter after the personality quiz if you don't like it. 

- A lot of other new features are coming, to follow all this, go to **[the server](https://discord.com/invite/ryT6ZtSBcg)**

## commisions

- emmuffin#2837 shared her commision sheet
![](./images/11-emuffin-commision.gif)

### While I'm here, and paid work is a serious subject, I'll also put older commition sheet :
#### Smalusion#3531
Extra notes:
- Portraits for a Pokemon with an existing Normal portrait are $12 each. 
- Giving an existing Pokemon the full set of animations a normal starter has would be around $300. This includes all 22 animations, offsets, and the xml file. It's a lot of work!
- Questions? Feel free to message me

## rom hacking via git
marius851000 (that's me) made a tool that allow you to use git for collaboration on pmd rom-hacking. [youtube video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj3ehSf2bB8)

## guide
*MaxSchersey made two video guide.*
New tutorials up for the hack jam! Since you'll be adding a new Pokemon to the game in this one, [I made a video on how to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecx8CUkO1rA).

And also [how to create custom start/end points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TS441onrI). Very helpful for differentiating from the standard Explorers of Sky boundaries.

- AddTypes / ImplementFairyGummies / ExtractBarItemList (by @Irdkwia): Patches to add a fairy type (or possibly a custom one) to the game
- ChooseStarter / SkipQuiz (by @Irdkwia): Patches to ask the player for their Pok√©mon to play as either after the test or instead of the test
- AddExperienceShare (by @Irdkwia): Adds Gates to Infinity-style experience share to the game
- FixEvolutionGlitch (NA only, by @Irdkwia): Fixes the evolution crash glitch on NA ROMs
- ExtraSpace (by @End): Base patch that provides more space for other patches to use
- ExtractDungeonData (by @Irdkwia): Base for editing rank and no mission properies on floors

## skytemple hack jam
### announcement
*Parakoopa on the skytemple Discord*

**THE FIRST SKYTEMPLE HACK JAM!**

It's finally time! Join us in the first (of hopefully many) SkyTemple hack game jam!

It's time to come together to create some hacks - You can join alone or with a team and we can't wait to see what creative hacks you will create!

The jam will have a **topic** your hack has to interpret in a creative way. We will announce that once the jam starts.

**The jam will go two weeks from Friday May 7th 10AM MST to Friday May 21st 10AM MST.**

If you want to be notified of updates on game jams in the future, assign yourself the Hack Jam Update role ( trophy ) in #rules-and-roles  (I won't ping everyone again.)

If you have any questions, we have a new channel #hack-jam-discussion for questions and discussions around the jam.

### organisation sheet of Glasses Freek Jr

**So** -- hypothetically, if people like me or @Team Fire Spark over here (just realized how much clout he has, goddamn) were to jam it together, roles would still need to be delegated. Ideas will get fledged the fullest if team composition doesn't sway too far in one direction or the other. Can't have a team full of aspiring writers with not a coder or two between them, lol.

Ergo, I've created, like, **a spreadsheet for groups** that would list **members** together, their **areas of expertise**, and **what they're still looking for**. During my brief stint at Smogon Roleplay (yes, that was once a thing), people would make Google Docs for whatever game would be played next. Some of them were very well-formatted, I may add, and they payed dividends with regards to how much fun we had. Until Smogon banned roleplayers. Can't blame 'em.

Unless I've grossly misjudged the slap-together nature of a ROM Hack Game Jam, I figured it would help to be smart about this sort of thing. If this is, like, metagaming or something I'll get rid of it.

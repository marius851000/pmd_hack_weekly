Here is the [link to the patch](https://projectpokemon.org/home/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=49036) and the [link to the changelog](https://projectpokemon.org/home/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=49035) (as long as usual).

The 3 first line of the changelog state :
> FYI: This is by far the biggest update yet. I would recommend restarting with a new save, however this isn't mandatory or won't cause major issues (Just delete the now blank Moonblast move from any Pokemon you've recruited that may have it)
> 
> Seriously, this is a BIG update. I really recommend reading the "New This Update" and "Bug Fixes" section. (Besides, I work hard on this thing)
> 
> Additionally, the reason this update took so long to get out is because I released the first half of it as a beta-test for my Discord members, thank you to everyone who beta tested and helped me fix important bugs before releasing such a massive update.

## SkyTemple Hack Jam - Still ongoing
The hack jam is still ongoing!

As a reminder, the topic is "**An Unlikely Team**" with the gimmick, "**Have a PokÃ©mon not present in the base game take an important role**."

The last week, deadline were extended to **May 28th 4pm UTC** (one extra week).


## SkyTemple - Bugfixes and planning
> **SkyTemple 1.2.3**
> Download: https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/4193-skytemple-pmd2-rom-edtior/
> 
> Bugfixes:
> - Fixed a corruption bug when applying the patch ExtractHardcodedItemLists after ExtractDungeonData (thanks to Irdkwia)

Parakoopa also made an announcement targeting beta testers and skytemple contributors.
> Hey! I'm currently planning SkyTemple 2.2. I want to make it all about editing minor things you currently need a hex editor for + editing the level list.
>
> I made a project on Github:
> 
> [https://github.com/orgs/SkyTemple/projects/4](https://github.com/orgs/SkyTemple/projects/4)
> 
> Are there more things that I might have missed? Tell me here and I'll add them or create an issue on Github directly.

Since some people outside of my Discord are having trouble patching, here's some instructions:

1. Skies uses a U.S Xenophobe ROM dump as the base ROM. That means to patch Skies to a game you will need that specific ROM. I can not legally distribute ROMs, but I can give out a patch that will convert clean copies of North American U.S Explorers of Sky to the Xenophobe dump. You can find this patch here: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/y62fstq47i1u5gm/clean_to_xeno.xdelta?dl=1


2. You will need a special version of an updated xDelta to patch Skies. You can find this specific xDelta at:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/3a6wxvmpyn452cx/xdelta.zip?dl=1

Alternatively, you can *try*:
https://hack64.net/tools/patcher.php

3. If you don't have a US Xenophobe Dump, you'll need to use the updated xDelta or the hack64 patcher found in step #2 (If you do have a US Xenophobe dump you can skip this step). Apply the Xeno patch to the clean ROM.

4. Open your software and choose the US Xenophobe Explorers Of Sky ROM as the base, and the Skies Patch as the patch, choose an output destination and name, and you're all ready to play! You'll know this will have worked if the intro sequence is changed.

#### second announcement

Yo! Here's another new update with a quick rundown:

- Added Sylveon -- Evolves from Eevee with using a Beauty Scarf during evolution. Has Cute Charm and Synchronize as its abilities.
- Updated all Pokemon to have their correct Gen 6 typings. (Distributed Fairy type to all Fairy types.)
- Added Fairy Gummis to Kecleon Shops and fixed their pricing.
- Fixed the corrupt kaomado file (again) so now ROM Hackers using Skies as a base can import new portraits to existing Pokemon.

### [Explorers of the azure sky](https://hacks.skytemple.org/h/azuresky)
*Mr. L on Discord*

Quick hotfix here! Turns out there was an issue with part of the female protagonist dialogue in chapter 2 that was causing a crash. This should fix it!
Thank you to @Shammywolf363 for pointing that out!

Hi! Here is some new news for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Hell! Thank you for following the project, I'm glad to see that! Here is some informations about the progress of the game! 

- V0.2 should be available at the end of April, the dialogues will be modified until the end of the expedition. 

- A new dungeon : Tower of God. The ultimate dungeon, no recruitment, level 100 pokemon and huge bosses every 20 floors (example below). 

- When you recruit a Legendary Pokemon, they will be either level 85 or level 95.

- 5 dungeons "The Hell", all with different characteristics (For example, The Hell North will be the succession of all the bosses with "rest room" between 3 bosses) but an extreme difficulty. 

- The Tiny Woods from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red/Blue Rescue Team is back with the unlocked dungeons from Spinda's Café.

- Some characters from these games are also back....

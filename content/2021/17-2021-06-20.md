> I'll post here news about Explorers of Alpha
> 
> It's been 3 months I've been forced to take a pause of Alpha's development for several reasons, from lack of motivation to exhaustion about IRL problems, I had to take a pause
> 
> Now that I found a better pace in my life, I can slowly but gently get back into business with Alpha, and following that, here are the news!
>
> What's planned in 1.3 down below:
> 
> - you can now choose the starter you want as a player (credits go to Irdkwia for this patch)
> - personality test is now skipped at the start
> - added Post-Game Chapter Screens
> - updated Normal and Special Episodes icons
> - finishing TM compatibility
> - evolved starters have sleeping animations (requested in DMs)
> - adding a Darkrai rematch in Dark Crater, giving Primal Dialga's, Primal Palkia's and Antagonist Darkrai's exclusive items as a reward
> - adding a reward for Special Episode 5 completion: Partner Grovyle's, Antagonist Dusknoir's and Shiny Celebi's exclusive items
> - implementation of Fairy-Type, Fairy Gummi and Fairy Type-Relationships (credits go to Irdkwia), Fairy-exclusive items
> - addition of Fairy-Exclusive items and typings updated. Ninetales, Meganium, Bellossom, Illumise, Swablu, Altaria, Absol, Mismagius, Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, and Cresselia are now half Fairy-Type Pokemon
> - addition of Sylveon, being recruitable in Hidden Highland, Happy Outlook, and Starglow Cavern. Sylveon has an exclusive item being Sparkly Collar, which recovers HP when Sylveon is hit by Steel Type moves
> - Alolan-Vulpix and Alolan-Ninetales are playable, have an actual sprite (credits go to NeroIntruder for the sprite and Audino for the tool), exclusive items, and so on
> - Alolan-Vulpix is now an option as a starter
> - following move fixes come new moves
> NEW MOVES: Sludge Wave, Quiver Dance, Psystrike, Coil, Low Sweep, Scald, Shell Smash, Volt Switch, Bulldoze, Work Up, Drill Run, Dual Chop, Snarl, Hurricane, Mystical Fire, Origin Pulse, Precipice Blades, Dragon Ascent, High Horsepower, Breaking Swipe, Flip Turn, Dual Wingbeat, Scorching Sands, Hex, Triple Axel, Electro Ball, Psychic Fangs, Liquidation, Body Press, Mind Crush (being Psychic special counterpart of Body Press), Power-Up Punch, Petal Blizzard, Icicle Crash, Electroweb
> - following Fairy-Type implementation come fairy moves. Move being Fairy-type since Gen VI are updated to be Fairy-Type:
> FAIRY MOVES: Moonblast, Dazzling Gleam, Disarming Voice, Play Rough, Sparkly Wind (Silver Wind but Fairy-type), Moon Slash (physical High crit rate Fairy-move)
> - another new move has been implemented as a TM:
> Lucky Draw is an universal TM which is a random stat boosting move (boosting either Attack, Defense, Special Attack and Special Defense by 1 stage), and has 1% chance of boosting all stats by 1 stage, speed included on top of that
> - some usually useless moves were removed
> Kinesis, Sharpen, Spider Web, Barrage, Vacuum-Cut are no longer in the game
> - barring Lucky Draw, all these moves will be added to learnsets as either level-ups or egg moves
> - other moves have a special effect depending on the user:
> Crush Claw from Zangoose is guaranteed to lower the target's Defense
> Poison Tail from Seviper is guaranteed to badly poison the target
> Judgement changes Arceus' type depending on the target it first hits
> Arceus has access to a new move being Trinity Star, you'll see its effect ingame
> - regular attack has now sure-hit accuracy. As a result Sure-Hit Attacker IQ Skill will be replaced
> - removing Defender and Aggressor from S IQ Group
> - adding Alpha IQ Group for Arceus
> - Y-Ray Specs and Hunger Seeds are now banned from boss fights because of the unfair advantage they give to the player
> - changed spawnrate from 5 to 9, increased initial enemy spawn in dungeon, allowed imperfect rooms to be generated in most dungeons
> - changed Exclusive Items: Stern Sash, Afire Collar, Barrier Bow, Friend Torc, Fairy Bow
> - added a new place: Passage of Time, permiting a revisit of Special Episodes dungeons along with a new dungeon
> You can enter this place from Sharpedo Bluff exit after beating Darkrai
> - Sharpedo Bluff's base warp lets you go to Crossroads, Beach, or Wigglytuff's guild, but you can chose to go to Sharpedo bluff
> - removed Side Path, Rock Path and Forest Path from the game
> - new items: S-Vitamins, maximizing a pokemon stat (HP-Drink and Ginseng S exist aswell)
> - other new items include Heavenly Apple, replacing Mime Jr in Bazaar. This item is purely dungeon exclusive and will be removed after you leave dungeon
> - a new NPC in Spinda Café available after you unlock Marine Resort: Gliscor, trading S-Vitamins against money or other items
> - revamped some orbs effects (still WIP)
> - a new dungeon is available one time everytime you need to rescue yourself in Pelipper Island: Island of Salvation, where you can farm Exp, Reviver Seeds, etc
> - you can freely swap between Alternate Form and Origin Form on Giratina. For that you need to Maximize Giratina's IQ and go in Luminous Spring

::: title 3 NewAssets-BlossomHaze "First custom music in EOS - Blossom Haze"

*By Parakoopa, on the SkyTemple Discord server*

> KCN - 시안 transcribed the first ever full custom music track inside EoS (that I know of at least) - and all manually with a hex editor! Check it out!

*Youtube description*

> Blossom Haze (Press Garden act 2 music) from Sonic Mania
> 
> I transcribed this music for PMD:EoS. 
> 
> Substitutes Beach Cave BGM.
> 
> This is my first work, so there were many trial and error, and this may not be suitable for real hack, because the music itself seems to use all the track system can manage at some points.

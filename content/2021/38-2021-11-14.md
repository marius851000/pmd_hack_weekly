::: title 2 HackNews-Soulless "Soulless disqualified"

> Hi! We, the mods and the jury, have decided to **disqualify** the hack **The Soulless Life** from the hack jam.
>
> After a period of consideration we determined the hack is in violation of Rule 6. When submitting hacks, please make sure they don't violate any of our rules and please don't try to push the rules.
>
> Because of this, **if you voted for the hack, please change your vote now**. The hack will also not be listed in our hack list anymore.

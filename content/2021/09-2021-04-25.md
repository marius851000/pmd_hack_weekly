### Skyhard
Update: A special cutscene is almost complete! (legit 2 things left to do)

Work on Post-Game soon to be in progress! (You'll <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">hate</span> love what ideas i've come up with!)

Still missing portraits for: meditite/shuppet/shieldon/ponyta/spearow/combee/seedot... (If some amazing portrait drawers could get work done with that i'd be ever greatful)

### [explorer of skies](https://hacks.skytemple.org/h/skies)
It's been two weeks since the last update and I have a new one ready! This is the biggest mechanically game-changing update yet!

It features:
- New moves with custom animations!
- 10+ new Fairy Type moves
- 7 Brand-Spanking new TMs
- Weather Trio signature moves (Origin Pulse, Precipice Blades and Dragon Ascent)
- Moves from future generations (Bulldoze, Petal Blizzard, High Horsepower, etc.)
- Unused moves like Excavate and Spin Slash.
- Revamped Rank-Up Rewards
- Chikorita, Phanpy and Bulbasaur buffs
- Move buffs, nerfs and changes
- New custom frames
- And bug fixes

I put a lot of time into this update in particular and I hope you enjoy!

## skytemple-files
- Irdkwia [fixed the AddExperienceSharePatch](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-files/pull/109)
  - Prevents the Special Episode team (slots 2 to 4) from gaining exp when not in special episode
  - Joy Seeds / Golden Seeds at Spinda bar now adds 1/5 levels to the actual level the Pokémon should have from its current exp. and levels up the Pokémon to that level instead of just giving plain 1/5 levels and resetting their exp. points to that level

(note of marius851000 : It would be great if we have a page for new comer with the general advancement of mystery dungeon hacking (and not only explorer)

# news about the mystery dungeon rom-hacking starting from 12/02/2021 to 21/02/2021

## multi-game
- There is a [discord server about speedrun of rom-hack/fan games](https://discord.gg/kdZuUszQT6)

## explorer hacking
### general
- yakkomon and Jester [shared a document that list cutscene id in explorer of sky](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d0GKU60TXsnXa-I2xn7siSpF1ipL1QOv5ro9q37wRZQ/edit?usp=sharing).
- sack [shared a document sorting the different background by theme, including some of rescue teams](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D0O1NJynjSsVCyrt6LvMuQZMJy14-NR9IAYdUwSjsZA/edit).

### skytemple
- The server made a #hack-showcase channel for listing rom-hack.
- boredcrow24 [made a guide on how to add overworld sleeping animation based on the dungeon sleep animation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G0y-lM6wT6OG6r2LD2zZXMjgLq4Pj5f9fcwNCrI9ZPk/edit).
-- sudzoof [made a program to automate that](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/729951586058633219/809515802930708491/EoS_Sleep_Sprite_Adder.zip).
- Parakoopa [is making progress on skytemple translation](https://discord.com/channels/710190644152369162/712341699292037121/810591892520828958).
- End [shared a document where people developing assembly patch can store additional data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rs4icdYtiM6KYnWxMkdlw7jpWrH7qw5v6LOfDWIiYho/edit).

#### change in skytemple
(note of marius851000: could be automated)
- End45 [made the HP regeneration data unsigned](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-files/pull/77) (remark by marius851000: this mean the HP regeneration data can be more than 128)
- Cipnit [added some patch for the game](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-files/pull/78) This include :
  - Complete team controls, "Pressing start in a dungeon toggles between automatic and manual mode. In manual mode, you can control your partners on their turns. You must apply the extra code overlay made by End45 before applying this patch."
  - Partners trigger hidden traps, "Recommended for CTC. Without this patch, partners cannot trigger hidden traps - this balances the game, as making your partners dodge traps with manual movement is easy, but this patch is not recommended for mods which use pitfall traps, as they instakill partners which step on them."
  - Far-Off Pal overdrive, "Makes the game always move the PoV to your partners when they use moves or are attacked, even if the partner is only one tile away, when far-off pals is enabled. Recommended for CTC since the PoV stays on your last pokemon at the end of a manual movement round without this, and CTC already reduces the amount of time the game pauses for between PoV changes."
  - Reduce Jumpcut Pause Time, "Reduces the amount of time the game pauses for before changing the PoV when far-off pals is enabled, from 60 frames to 12. This is already applied in the CTC hack."
- You can now [translate skytemple](https://translate.skytemple.org/) via an easy to use interface!
- the NA evolution glitch was [fixed](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-files/pull/80) [twice](https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-files/pull/81).

### SpriteCollab
- Audino [shared a document in which he describe restriction on submission for SpriteCollab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w4hJmMfC30XgFZrh9v3CSyWotg-LV4_EYltdQXhKibI/edit#).
  - remark by marius851000: all the code for spritecollab are open-source, so someone willing to make an alternate repository for non-acceptable data could make without too much difficulties
